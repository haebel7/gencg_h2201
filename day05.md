# Day 05

## Reflect / Collect / Prepare

### Updating the Journal
On day 5, I mainly worked on completing the journal for the past week.

### Trying out Fractal Spirographs
Besides working on the journal, I also wanted to try out something different from day 4: Fractal spirographs. But in the end I didn't really come up with an original concept, and just played around with an example provided by The Coding Train (https://editor.p5js.org/codingtrain/sketches/Q60oWddzr).
Nonetheless, I still think the insight into the code was very interesting.

### Reflection
All in all I think the first week went very good, and I am satisfied with most of the things that I created.
