# Day 09

## Finishing the Journal
On the last day, I spent most of the time completing and tidying up my journal. I have written the last entries, including this one.

## Face Generator last Improvements
Being already really happy with the state of the generator as it was on day 8, I still wanted to make some last improvements. These were mainly new optional features, to ensure more variety in the faces. New forehead features, mouth expressions and more versatile noses were added.

While coming near the end of this project, I realized that the changes I made to the sketch became more and more subtle. At the first moment, you maybe don't even realize that something has changed in comparison to the version of day 8. But it's these small improvements that give the portraits just a little bit more personality.

### Possible Future Improvements
Looking at the generator as it is now, there are still some ideas floating around that could be realized with some more time:

- Add some more feminine traits, as all the faces right now tend to look more on the masculine side
- Refine existing facial features/make them interact more smoothly
- Color the portraits in some way (skin tone, background color, ...)
- Give the user some control over the generated features, for example through different sliders
